üåê Architecture Overview:
VPC with Subnets:

Public Subnet: Hosts Application Server (EC2)

Private Subnet: Hosts Database Server (EC2)

IAM Roles:

One for EC2 to access S3 (for backup)

One for users/admins with defined policies

EC2 Instances:

One for hosting the web application (Apache/Node/Django etc.)

One for hosting a secure database (MySQL/PostgreSQL)

S3 Bucket:

For storing regular database backups securely

Backup Plan:

Script or AWS Backup plan to take snapshots of EC2/database and push to S3

üîß Steps to Build:
Create VPC:

Custom VPC with 2 subnets: one public (App), one private (DB)

Setup route tables, internet gateway (for public), NAT gateway (for private)

Launch EC2 Instances:

App EC2 (in Public Subnet) ‚Äì Install web server & app code

DB EC2 (in Private Subnet) ‚Äì Install MySQL/Postgres

Configure IAM:

Create roles for EC2 to access S3

Create user roles (read-only, admin etc.)

Setup S3 Backup:

Create S3 bucket

Write cron job or Lambda function to backup DB regularly

Store snapshots or exports in S3

Security:

Use Security Groups and NACLs to restrict access

Only App EC2 can access DB EC2

Public access only for App EC2 (port 80/443)
